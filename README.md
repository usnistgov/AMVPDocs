# README

AMVPDocs will host documents for public discussion related to the Automated Cryptographic Module Validation Project (AMVP or ACVMP) run through the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE). For information on the project see: https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/automation-nist-cryptographic-module-validation-program.

## Contact

For more information about the project or this repository, reach out to Apostol Vassilev, apostol (dot) vassilev (at) nist (dot) gov. This project is maintained by the Security Testing Validation and Measurement Group within the Computer Security Division at NIST. 

## CODEOWNERS

This template repository includes a file named
[CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS), which visitors can view to discover
which GitHub users are "in charge" of the repository. More
crucially, GitHub uses it to assign reviewers on pull requests.
GitHub documents the file (and how to write one) [here][gh-cdo].

***Please update that file*** to point to your own account or
team, so that the [Open-Source Team][gh-ost] doesn't get spammed
with spurious review requests. *Thanks!*
